=== Description

An egg to work with the
[[https://github.com/transmission/transmission|Transmission]] (v3.01)
[[https://github.com/transmission/transmission/wiki/RPC-Protocol-Specification|RPC
protocol]] (v17). It assumes familiarity with the
[[https://github.com/transmission/transmission/blob/f59118d1fe6a320d797b151a6f235f739ef3b487/extras/rpc-spec.txt|spec]].

This egg may still work with a more recent version of the spec, but it's not
guaranteed. An example of a change in the spec that doesn't require any change
in the API is this:

<enscript>
17    | 3.01    | yes       | torrent-get          | new arg "file-count"
17    | 3.01    | yes       | torrent-get          | new arg "primary-mime-type"
</enscript>

This is because the library doesn't check if the fields are valid (this is
intentional).

These changes, however:

<enscript>
16    | 3.00    | yes       | session-get          | new request arg "fields"
16    | 3.00    | yes       | torrent-get          | new request arg "format"
</enscript>

Require API changes, because, otherwise, the {{fields}} and {{format}}
arguments can't be used.

=== API

==== {{transmission}} module

===== Parameters

<parameter>*host*</parameter>
<parameter>*url*</parameter>
<parameter>*port*</parameter>
<parameter>*username*</parameter>
<parameter>*password*</parameter>
<parameter>*session-id*</parameter>

===== High-level RPC API

Every method of the spec is defined, and naming is followed almost directly. In
the spec, all methods and most arguments follow the {{kebab-case}} convention.
The exceptions are a few arguments in {{camelCase}} -- these are converted to
{{kebab-case}} in this egg: e.g., the key argument for {{queuePosition}} is
called {{queue-position}}. Note, however, that the messages are left untouched:
a message to/from the server will still use {{queuePosition}} as the key,
'''NOT''' {{queue-position}}.

Almost all required parameters are positional arguments in the library -- the
only exception is the {{ids}} argument, which is always a key argument, even
for methods with required {{ids}}, because it defaults to no IDs to avoid
acting on torrents by accident.

All optional arguments in the spec are key arguments in the library.

<procedure>torrent-source/filename</procedure>
<procedure>torrent-source/metainfo</procedure>

Create a torrent source to use with {{torrent-add}}. A torrent can be added
from a magnet URL; or from a torrent file, given the file's path, which must be
accessible by the Transmission daemon, or the contents of the file, encoded in
Base64.

{{torrent-source/filename}} is used for magnets and file paths;
{{torrent-source/metainfo}} is used for Base64 encoded torrent files.

====== Results

Every API procedure returns a {{result}}, which is a SRFI-189 {{Either}}
object. The most useful and most commonly used procedures for handling results
are renamed and exported. On top of these, some others are defined.

<procedure>(true . _)</procedure>
<procedure>(false . _)</procedure>

{{true}} and {{false}} return {{#t}} and {{#f}} respectively, independently of
the arguments they're called with.

<procedure>(result/error obj ...)</procedure>
<procedure>(result/error? obj)</procedure>
<procedure>(result/ok obj ...)</procedure>
<procedure>(result/ok? obj)</procedure>
<procedure>(result? obj)</procedure>
<procedure>(result-bind result mproc1 mproc2 ...)</procedure>
<procedure>(result-ref result failure [success])</procedure>
<procedure>(exception->result pred thunk)</procedure>

Renames of SRFI-189. The {{result/error}} related functions are the {{left}}
related functions from SRFI-189; and the {{result/ok}} related functions are
the {{right}} related functions from SRFI-189.

<procedure>(result/error-ref result #!optional (fail false))</procedure>
<procedure>(result/ok-ref result #!optional (fail false))</procedure>

If the object is of the expected alternative ({{result/error}} or
{{result/ok}}), return the values contained in it; otherwise, call {{fail}} on
the values contained in the object, which by default, returns {{#f}}.

<procedure>(result-ref* result)</procedure>

Return the values contained in a result object, whether it's a {{result/error}}
or {{result/ok}}.

<procedure>(default-error-proc result/con #!optional tag req resp)</procedure>
<procedure>(with-transmission-result result success-proc #!optional (error-proc default-error-proc))</procedure>

Convenient way to handle a single RPC call's result.

{{with-transmission-result}} is similar to {{result-ref}} ({{either-ref}} from
SRFI-189), except that the order of the success and failure procedures is
swapped. The failure procedure defaults to {{default-error-proc}}, which calls
{{error}} with a generic error message.

{{success-proc}} should be a procedure of 4 parameters: the {{arguments}} and
{{tag}} fields of a reply message, the {{uri-common}} request object, and the
{{intarweb}} response object.

{{failure-proc}} should be a procedure of 4 parameters, 3 of them optional:
{{result/con}}, {{tag}}, {{req}}, and {{resp}}. {{result}} and {{tag}} are the
fields of a reply message, {{req}} is the {{uri-common}} request object, and
{{resp}} is the {{intarweb}} response object. {{tag}}, {{req}}, and {{resp}}
are either all false or none false. If they're false, {{result/con}} is a
{{condition}} object thrown during the API call; if they're not false, then
{{result/con}} is a {{result}} string.

===== Low-level API

<macro>(make-rpc-call (method (required required-handler) ...) (key default key-handler) ...)</macro>
<macro>(make-rpc-call method (key default key-handler) ...)</macro>
<macro>(define-rpc-call (method required ...) key ...)</macro>
<macro>(define-rpc-call method key ...)</macro>
<macro>(export-rpc-call (method required ...) key ...)</macro>
<macro>(export-rpc-call method key ...)</macro>
<macro>(export-3.1/4.6 method)</macro>

{{make-rpc-call}} creates a procedure to represent an RPC method.

{{define-rpc-call}} is like {{make-rpc-call}} but defines the created
procedure.

{{export-rpc-call}} is like {{define-rpc-call}} but exports the defined
procedure.

{{export-3.1/4.6}} exports RPC procedures of sections 3.1 and 4.6 of the spec,
which have a single optional {{ids}} argument.

{{method}} is a method name, which will be used as the method name in messages
and, in the case of {{define-rpc-call}}, {{export-rpc-call}}, and
{{export-3.1/4.6}}, the name of the defined procedure.

{{required}} is the name of a required argument. It will not be used in
messages.

{{key}} is the name of an optional (key) argument. It will be used as the key
name in the created procedure, but not in messages.

{{required-handler}} and {{key-handler}} are functions that will process a
given value, to assure it has the right type/format, and return an entry ready
to be inserted into the {{arguments}} object of a message, i.e., they must return
a {{(key . value)}} pair that will later be converted to JSON.

{{default}} is the default value of an optional (key) argument.

<procedure>(rpc-call method #!key (arguments #f) (tag #f))</procedure>

Make an RPC call. {{method}} is the name of the RPC method, and {{arguments}}
is the {{arguments}} object, containing both required and optional arguments.

<procedure>(handle-409 condition request message)</procedure>
<procedure>(http-call request message)</procedure>
<procedure>(update-request-session-id request #!optional (session-id (*session-id*)))</procedure>
<procedure>(make-serialized-message method arguments tag)</procedure>
<procedure>(make-message method arguments tag)</procedure>
<procedure>(make-rpc-request host url port username password #!optional (session-id (*session-id*)))</procedure>

==== {{transmission.utils}} module

<syntax>(alist-let alist (key ...) body ...)</syntax>
<syntax>(alist-let/and alist (key ...) body ...)</syntax>
<syntax>(alist-let/nor alist (key ...) body ...)</syntax>

Equivalent to:

<enscript highlight="scheme">
(let ((key (alist-ref 'key alist))
      ...)
  body
  ...)
</enscript>

Except that, with {{alist-let/and}}, if {{alist}} is false, the value of the
whole expression is false; and with {{alist-let/nor}}, if {{alist}} is false,
the value of the whole expression is true.

<procedure>(unique-tag! #!optional (new-n #f))</procedure>

Return an unique tag, that starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 on each call. If
{{new-n}} is given and is a {{fixnum?}}, set the internal variable to {{new-n}}
for future use.

<constant>status/stopped</constant>
<constant>status/check-wait</constant>
<constant>status/check</constant>
<constant>status/download-wait</constant>
<constant>status/download</constant>
<constant>status/seed-wait</constant>
<constant>status/seed</constant>

The torrent status constants.

<constant>priority/low</constant>
<constant>priority/normal</constant>
<constant>priority/high</constant>

The priority constants -- for {{bandwidth-priority}}.

=== Examples

<enscript highlight="scheme">
(import srfi-1 transmission transmission.utils)

(parameterize ((*host* "hostname")
               (*username* "username")
               (*password* "password"))
  (let ((tag (unique-tag!)))
    (with-transmission-result
      (torrent-get '("downloadDir" "id" "name" "status" "uploadRatio") #:ids #f #:tag tag)
      (lambda (arguments tag req resp)
        (define (want-torrent? tor)
          (alist-let/and tor (downloadDir status uploadRatio)
                         (and (= status status/seed)
                              (> uploadRatio 1)
                              (string=? downloadDir "/some/path/"))))
        (alist-let/and arguments (torrents)
                       (let ((wanted-tors (filter want-torrent? (vector->list torrents))))
                         (for-each print wanted-tors))))
      ; NOTE: The error case handling procedure doesn't have to accept
      ;       #!optional arguments -- the "missing" arguments will be #f.
      (lambda (result tag req resp)
        (error 'here "torrent-get call failed with the following error" result)))))

=== Version History

==== 0.2.1 (2020/12/DD)

* {{default-error-proc}} now supports the case where the result was just a
  condition.

==== 0.2.0 (2020/12/09)

* Return a more functional {{result}} object from API calls instead of a more
  C-like {{reply}} for easier error handling. There's no chance to mistake an
  error for a good result now;

* Improve {{alist-let/and}} and {{alist-let/nor}} to support optional variable
  names;

* Add {{priority}} constants;

* Rename {{unique-tag}} to {{unique-tag!}};

* Replace [[vector-lib]] with [[r7rs]] because [[srfi-189]] depends on it
  anyway.

==== 0.1.1 (2020/12/02)

Add {{with-transmission-reply}} and update the documentation accordingly.

==== 0.1.0 (2020/12/01)

Initial release with all methods defined, and almost all tested.
